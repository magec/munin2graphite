  body: This function implements a (probably too simle) method to detect whether the program with the pid found in the pid-file is still running. It just searches for the pid in the output of <tt>ps ax</tt>, which is probably not a good idea in some cases. Alternatives would be to use a direct access method the unix process control system.
