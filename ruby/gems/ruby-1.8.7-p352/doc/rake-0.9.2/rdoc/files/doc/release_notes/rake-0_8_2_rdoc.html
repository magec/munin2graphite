      <h1>Rake 0.8.2 Released</h1>
<p>
Rake version 0.8.2 is a new release of rake that includes a number of new
features and numerous bug fixes.
</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<h3>New Features in Version 0.8.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Switched from getoptlong to optparse (patches supplied by Edwin Pratomo).

</li>
<li>The -T option will now attempt to dynamically sense the size of the
terminal. The -T output will only self-truncate if the output is a tty.
However, if RAKE_COLUMNS is explicitly set, it will be honored in any case.
(Patch provided by Gavin Stark).

</li>
<li>The following public methods have been added to rake task objects:

<ul>
<li>task.clear &#8212; Clear both the prerequisites and actions of the target
rake task.

</li>
<li>task.clear_prerequisites &#8212; Clear all the existing prerequisites from
the target rake task.

</li>
<li>task.clear_actions &#8212; Clear all the existing actions from the target
rake task.

</li>
<li>task.reenable &#8212; Re-enable a task, allowing its actions to be executed
again if the task is invoked.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed RDoc test task to have no default template. This makes it easier
for the tempate to pick up the template from the environment.

</li>
<li>Default values for task arguments can easily be specified with the
:with_defaults method. (Idea for default argument merging supplied by (Adam
Q. Salter)

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes in Version 0.8.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in package task so that it will include the subdir directory in
the package for testing. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

</li>
<li>Fixed filename dependency order bug in test_inspect_pending and
test_to_s_pending. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

</li>
<li>Fixed check for file utils options to make them immune to the symbol/string
differences. (Patch supplied by Edwin Pratomo)

</li>
<li>Fixed bug with rules involving multiple source, where only the first
dependency of a rule has any effect (Patch supplied by Emanuel Indermühle)

</li>
<li>FileList#clone and FileList#dup have better sematics w.r.t. taint and
freeze.

</li>
<li>Changed from using Mutex to Monitor. Evidently Mutex causes thread join
errors when Ruby is compiled with -disable-pthreads. (Patch supplied by
Ittay Dror)

</li>
<li>Fixed bug in makefile parser that had problems with extra spaces in file
task names. (Patch supplied by Ittay Dror)

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other changes in Version 0.8.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added ENV var to rake&#8216;s own Rakefile to prevent OS X from including
extended attribute junk in the rake package tar file. (Bug found by Adam
Majer)

</li>
<li>Added a performance patch for reading large makefile dependency files.
(Patch supplied by Ittay Dror)

</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Rake</h2>
<p>
Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways. But instead
of cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to declare tasks and
dependencies. You have the full power of a modern scripting language built
right into your build tool.
</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">Home Page:</td><td><a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">rake.rubyforge.org</a>/

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Download:</td><td><a
href="http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50">rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50</a>

</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Task Argument Examples</h2>
<p>
Prior to version 0.8.0, rake was only able to handle command line arguments
of the form NAME=VALUE that were passed into Rake via the ENV hash. Many
folks had asked for some kind of simple command line arguments, perhaps
using &quot;&#8212;&quot; to separate regular task names from argument
values on the command line. The problem is that there was no easy way to
associate positional arguments on the command line with different tasks.
Suppose both tasks :a and :b expect a command line argument: does the first
value go with :a? What if :b is run first? Should it then get the first
command line argument.
</p>
<p>
Rake 0.8.0 solves this problem by explicitly passing values directly to the
tasks that need them. For example, if I had a release task that required a
version number, I could say:
</p>
<pre>
   rake release[0.8.2]
</pre>
<p>
And the string &quot;0.8.2&quot; will be passed to the :release task.
Multiple arguments can be passed by separating them with a comma, for
example:
</p>
<pre>
   rake name[john,doe]
</pre>
<p>
Just a few words of caution. The rake task name and its arguments need to
be a single command line argument to rake. This generally means no spaces.
If spaces are needed, then the entire rake + argument string should be
quoted. Something like this:
</p>
<pre>
   rake &quot;name[billy bob, smith]&quot;
</pre>
<p>
(Quoting rules vary between operating systems and shells, so make sure you
consult the proper docs for your OS/shell).
</p>
<h3>Tasks that Expect Parameters</h3>
<p>
Parameters are only given to tasks that are setup to expect them. In order
to handle named parameters, the task declaration syntax for tasks has been
extended slightly.
</p>
<p>
For example, a task that needs a first name and last name might be declared
as:
</p>
<pre>
   task :name, :first_name, :last_name
</pre>
<p>
The first argument is still the name of the task (:name in this case). The
next to argumements are the names of the parameters expected by :name
(:first_name and :last_name in the example).
</p>
<p>
To access the values of the paramters, the block defining the task
behaviour can now accept a second parameter:
</p>
<pre>
   task :name, :first_name, :last_name do |t, args|
     puts &quot;First name is #{args.first_name}&quot;
     puts &quot;Last  name is #{args.last_name}&quot;
   end
</pre>
<p>
The first argument of the block &quot;t&quot; is always bound to the
current task object. The second argument &quot;args&quot; is an open-struct
like object that allows access to the task arguments. Extra command line
arguments to a task are ignored. Missing command line arguments are given
the nil value.
</p>
