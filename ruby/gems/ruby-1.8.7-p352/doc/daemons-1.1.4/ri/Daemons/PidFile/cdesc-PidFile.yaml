  text: What is a Pid-File?
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: A <em>Pid-File</em> is a file containing the <em>process identification number</em> (pid) that is stored in a well-defined location of the filesystem thus allowing other programs to find out the pid of a running script.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Daemons needs the pid of the scripts that are currently running in the background to send them so called <em>signals</em>. Daemons uses the <tt>TERM</tt> signal to tell the script to exit when you issue a <tt>stop</tt> command.

  text: How does a Pid-File look like?

  body: "Pid-Files generated by Daemons have to following format:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  &lt;scriptname&gt;.rb&lt;number&gt;.pid\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: (Note that <tt>&lt;number&gt;</tt> is omitted if only one instance of the script can run at any time)
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Each file just contains one line with the pid as string (for example <tt>6432</tt>).

    body: in a directory relative to the directory where the script (the one that is supposed to run as a daemon) resides (<tt>:script</tt> option for <tt>:dir_mode</tt>)
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "2."
    body: in a directory given by <tt>:dir</tt> (<tt>:normal</tt> option for <tt>:dir_mode</tt>)
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI
