# Munin-Ruby

Munin-ruby is a sockets-based ruby client library to communicate and fetch information from munin-node servers.

## Installation

Simple install using rubygems:

```
gem install munin-ruby
```

## Usage

Just require the gem and you're good to go.

```ruby
require 'munin-ruby'

node = Munin::Node.new
node.version # => 1.4.4
```

### Connections

```ruby
# Connects to 127.0.0.1:4949
node = Munin::Node.new
node = Munin::Node.new('YOUR_HOST', YOUR_PORT)
```

If munin-node has any restrictions on IP addresses, client will trigger ```Munin::AccessDenied``` exception.

By default client will reconnect if connection was lost. To disable that specify ```false``` after port option.

```ruby
node = Munin::Node.new('YOUR_HOST', 4949, false)
```

Ways to disconnect:

```
# Disconnect from server
node.disconnect
node.connection.close
```

In case if automatic reconnection was enabled, service will establish connection even after you call 'disconnect' method.

To force client not to open connection: ```node.disconnect(false)```. 

This will trigger ```Munin::ConnectionError``` on any client calls.

### Services and metrics

See what's available on server:

```ruby
services = node.list 

# => ["cpu","df", "df_inode", "entropy", "forks", ...]
```

#### Get service configuration

```ruby
config = node.config('cpu')
```

This will produce the following result:

```
{"graph"=>
  {"title"=>"CPU usage",
   "order"=>"system user nice idle iowait irq softirq",
   "args"=>
    {"raw"=>"--base 1000 -r --lower-limit 0 --upper-limit 400",
     "parsed"=>{"base"=>"1000", "lower-limit"=>"0", "upper-limit"=>"400"}},
   "vlabel"=>"%",
   "scale"=>"no",
   "info"=>"This graph shows how CPU time is spent.",
   "category"=>"system",
   "period"=>"second"},
 "metrics"=>
  {"system"=>
    {"label"=>"system",
     "draw"=>"AREA",
     "min"=>"0",
     "type"=>"DERIVE",
     "info"=>"CPU time spent by the kernel in system activities"},
   "user"=>
    {"label"=>"user",
     "draw"=>"STACK",
     "min"=>"0",
     "type"=>"DERIVE",
     "info"=>"CPU time spent by normal programs and daemons"},
   "nice"=>
    {"label"=>"nice",

     "info"=>"CPU time spent by nice(1)d programs"},
   "idle"=>
    {"label"=>"idle",
     "draw"=>"STACK",
     "min"=>"0",
     "type"=>"DERIVE",
     "info"=>"Idle CPU time"},
   "iowait"=>
    {"label"=>"iowait",
     "draw"=>"STACK",
     "min"=>"0",
     "type"=>"DERIVE",
     "info"=>
      "CPU time spent waiting for I/O operations to finish when there is nothing else to do."},
   "irq"=>
    {"label"=>"irq",
     "draw"=>"STACK",
     "min"=>"0",
     "type"=>"DERIVE",
     "info"=>"CPU time spent handling interrupts"},
   "softirq"=>
    {"label"=>"softirq",
     "draw"=>"STACK",
     "min"=>"0",
     "type"=>"DERIVE",
     "info"=>"CPU time spent handling \"batched\" interrupts"},
   "steal"=>
    {"label"=>"steal",
     "draw"=>"STACK",
     "min"=>"0",
     "type"=>"DERIVE",
     "info"=>
      "The time that a virtual CPU had runnable tasks, but the virtual CPU itself was not running"}}}
```

#### Fetch a single service

```ruby
service = node.fetch('cpu')
```

Output:

```
{"user"=>"140349907",
 "nice"=>"0",
 "system"=>"19694121",
 "idle"=>"536427034",
 "iowait"=>"6455996",
 "irq"=>"445",
 "softirq"=>"482942",
 "steal"=>"635801"}
```
