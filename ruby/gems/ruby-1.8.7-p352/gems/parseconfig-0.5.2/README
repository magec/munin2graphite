== DESCRIPTION:
  
rb-parseconfig is a Ruby class written to parse simple configuration 
files in the format of 'param = value'. The key benefit is that your ruby 
scripts can use the same configuration files of most unix/linux 
applications.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
  
Parsing of simple configuration files (not Ruby specific).
Allows ruby applications as well as Bash Init scripts to use the same config.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require('rubygems')
  require('parseconfig')
  config = ParseConfig.new('/path/to/config/file')
  puts config['log_file']
  puts config['pid_file']
  ...

== REQUIREMENTS:

  * Ruby (Developed on 1.8.6)
  * RubyGems 

== INSTALL:

  sudo gem install parseconfig
